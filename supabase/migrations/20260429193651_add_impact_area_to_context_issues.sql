-- Reconstructed 2026-09-26 from supabase_migrations.schema_migrations, which
-- stores the SQL each migration actually executed. This one was applied through
-- the Supabase dashboard and had no file in the repo, so `supabase db push`
-- refused every push with "remote migration versions not found in local".
-- It is a record of what ran, not hand-authored SQL. Do not edit to change
-- behaviour: the statements below have already executed in production.

ALTER TABLE qms_context_issues ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS impact_area text;
